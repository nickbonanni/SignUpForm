This is my SignUpForm app.

The form accepts 4 parameters: a name/email/password/password confirmation.
If any field is left empty the user will be presented with a warning.
If the password and password confirmation do not match the user will be shown a different warning.

Once every field is filled and the passwords match the user will be presented with a message welcoming them to the form.
